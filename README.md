# Material UI Crash Course
This repo will contain all of the code that I write as I follow along with Material UI tutorials to improve my skills in styling React code.

I will be following the tutorials here:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1chMISeTC0

Not sure if I'll be adding any further tutorials but I think I may also add some practice components to use for further reference when I am finished with the tutorials.
